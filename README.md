### Project Overview
This project analyzes accelerometer data from human activities (walking, running, climbing up, climbing down) using permutation entropy and complexity metrics. By identifying optimal parameters for distinguishing between different physical activities, this work contributes to the rapidly growing field of human activity recognition, which has critical applications across healthcare, fitness, industrial safety, and smart environments.

## Dataset
The dataset contains accelerometer readings from 15 subjects performing four activities:
- Walking
- Running
- Climbing up
- Climbing down

Data was collected from chest-mounted sensors, capturing acceleration in the x, y, and z axes.

### Project Tasks

### Task 1: Load the Required Data
- Loading accelerometer data for all subjects and activities
- Processing and organizing the data for analysis

### Task 2: Compute Permutation Entropy and Complexity
Computing permutation entropy and complexity for various parameter combinations:
- Embedded Dimensions: 3, 4, 5, 6
- Embedded Delays: 1, 2, 3
- Signal Lengths: 1024, 2048, 4096

The calculations were performed for all subjects, activities, and accelerometer axes, resulting in 6480 rows of data.

### Task 3: Filter Data for a Specific Subject, Axis, and Signal Length
Selected Subject 3, x-axis accelerometer data for detailed analysis.

### Task 4: Identify Optimal Parameters for Walking vs. Running
Created scatter plots to identify the optimal dimension and delay for distinguishing walking from running activities.

**Findings:**
- Walking: Lower permutation entropy (~0.75) and higher complexity (~0.22)
- Running: Higher permutation entropy (~0.88) and lower complexity (~0.13)
- **Optimal parameters:** Dimension=5, Delay=2

### Task 5: Identify Optimal Parameters for Climbing Up vs. Climbing Down
Created scatter plots to identify the optimal dimension and delay for distinguishing climbing up from climbing down.

**Findings:**
- Climbing Up: Higher permutation entropy (~0.83) and lower complexity (~0.17)
- Climbing Down: Lower permutation entropy (~0.79) and higher complexity (~0.20)
- **Optimal parameters:** Dimension=4, Delay=3
